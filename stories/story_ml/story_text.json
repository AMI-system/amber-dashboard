    "title": "Why Machine Learning at the Edge?",
    "text": "Each AMI system can capture thousands of images per week, often in places with no power or connectivity. We use machine learning at the edge to process data locally, filtering noise, flagging wildlife, and saving only the most relevant images.",

    "text": "Our models first locate animals in the images using object detection. This step filters out empty frames and crops detected regions, preparing data for downstream classification tasks, all on a low-power device.",
